Consider a table where all fields outside the primary key are nullable.

Multiple asynchronous processes can then contribute multiple values to the row, say through a REST API. Attached to the table can be one or more triggers that specify a subset of the fields in the table, where once all those fields are ground, the trigger runs once, receiving those field values as its arguments.

IOW, APIs should support currying and letting the user create new endpoints.''',

Yes, there are security implications, and yes, we might want to avoid making this Turing complete, but these problems are both surmountable.''',

My Ruby code will be able to call your Rust code in nanoseconds. I donâ€˜t need to trust your Rust code to use it. Supply-chain attacks will be almost non-existent. 
    
The economics of code reuse is completely changed when I can write one really good implementation of a fourier transform and then everyone, in every programming language, will be able to use it.
    
Much of the reason for Virtual Machines is gone.
    
When I can safely run your code on my back end, API design will be radically changed.
